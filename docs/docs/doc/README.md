# Introduction

## **Hora Search Everywhere!**

Hora, a **approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm** library. We implement all code in `Rustü¶Ä` for reliability, high level abstraction and high speed comparable to `C++`, these make it really suitable for Artificial Intellingence Computing scene.

Hora, **`„Äå„Åª„Çâ„Äç`** in Japanese, sound like `[h≈çl…ô]`, means `Wow`, `You see!` or `Look at that!`. he name is inspired by a famous lyrics **`„Äå„Åª„Çâ „ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„Å´„Å®„Å£„Å¶Â§ß‰∫ã„Å™‰∫∫„Åª„Å© „Åô„Åê„Åù„Å∞„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã„ÅÆ„Äç`** of a famous Japanese song **`Â∞è„Åï„Å™ÊÅã„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Åü`**, it means **`You See, the most important people to you is always stay near you`**


# Approximate Nearest Neighbor

As shown in the picture below, we have a large data set. Each piece of data is an `array<float>` (usually a float) representing a store. Now the request is also an `array<float>`. We now hope that we Find k points with the smallest $Distance<query, candidate_i>$ in the data set.

make it in math language:

ND-dim query vectors $\qquad X= x_1,x_2,...,x_i \qquad M<<N$

1D-dim query vector $\qquad q$

Task:Given  $q$ and $x \in X$, find top K $x_i$  which has smallest $Distance(q , x_i) (x \in X)$

for futher more information, I really recommend this speech tutorial `[CVPR20 Tutorial] Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search` present in `CVPR2020`

# Related Projects and Comparison

* [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann): 
  * **`Hora`'s implementation is strongly inspired by these lib.**
  * `Faiss` focus more on the GPu scenerio, and `Hora` is lighter than Faiss, such as **no heavy dependency**.
  * `Hora` expects to support more language, and everything related to performance shall be implemented by Rustü¶Ä.
  * `Annoy` only support `LSH(Random Projection)` algorithm.
  * `ScaNN` and `Faiss` are less user-friendly, such as lack of document.
  * Hora is **ALL IN RUST** ü¶Ä.

* [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina)
  * `Milvus` and `Vald` also support multiple languages, but serve as a service instead of a lib
  * `Milvus` is built upon some libs such as `Faiss`, while `Hora` is an algorithm lib with all the algo implemented by itself
