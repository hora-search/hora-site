# Introduction

### **Hora Search Everywhere!**

Hora, a approximate nearest neighbor search algorithm library, all code implemented in Rust ü¶Ä, because we think rust code is reliable, high level abstraction and its speed is really blazingly fast, these make it really suitable for Artificial Intellingence Computing scene.

Hora, „Åª„Çâ in Japanese, sound like [h≈çl…ô], means Wow, You see! or Look at that!. he name is inspired by a famous lyrics **`„Äå„Åª„Çâ „ÅÇ„Å™„Åü„Å´„Å®„Å£„Å¶Â§ß‰∫ã„Å™‰∫∫„Åª„Å© „Åô„Åê„Åù„Å∞„Å´„ÅÑ„Çã„ÅÆ„Äç`** of a famous Japanese song **`Â∞è„Åï„Å™ÊÅã„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Åü`**, it means **`You See, the most important people to you is always stay near you`**


## Approximate Nearest Neighbor

As shown in the picture below, we have a large data set. Each piece of data is an `array<float>` (usually a float) representing a store. Now the request is also an `array<float>`. We now hope that we Find k points with the smallest $Distance<query, candidate_i>$ in the data set.

make it in math language:

ND-dim query vectors $\qquad X= x_1,x_2,...,x_i \qquad M<<N$

1D-dim query vector $\qquad q$

Task:Given  $q$ and $x \in X$, find top K $x_i$  which has smallest $Distance(q , x_i) (x \in X)$

for futher more information, I really recommend this speech tutorial `[CVPR20 Tutorial] Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search` present in `CVPR2020`

## Related Project and Comparison

* [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [ScaNN](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann): 
  * **In fact `Hora`'s implementation is strongly inspired by these lib.**
  * `Faiss` more focus on the GPU scene, and `Hora` is more light than Faiss
  * `Hora` wish to support more language, and all the thing related to speed should be implemented by Rustü¶Ä
  * `Annoy` only implement `LSH(Random Projection)` algorithm
  * `ScaNN` and `Faiss` is not easy to use, it's lack of document.
  * **ALL IN RUST** ü¶Ä

* [Milvus](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus), [Vald](https://github.com/vdaas/vald), [Jina AI](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina)
  * `Milvus` and `Vald` also support multiple languages, but it serve as a service, not a lib
  * `Milvus` is built upon some libs like `Faiss`, but `Hora` is a algorithm lib, all the algo is implemented by itself
